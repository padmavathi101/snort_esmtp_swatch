SNORT_SWATCH_ESMTP
first i used snort to have firewall rules defined lets say icmp rules

then i used esmtprc to configure email setup 

and then use swatch to watch over the log files of snort and send mails using esmtp

one note remove msg1.txt before running every time snort or else older ones will be run
